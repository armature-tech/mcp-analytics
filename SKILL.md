  Wire the @armature-tech/mcp-analytics SDK into an existing MCP server so tool calls
  emit telemetry to Armature. Use whenever the user wants to add, install, integrate,
  or instrument analytics on an MCP server — e.g. "add Armature analytics to this MCP",
  "instrument my tools", "wire mcp-analytics into our server". Detects which integration
  shape fits the repo (registry-style McpServer, drop-in factory, dispatcher, or Mastra
  MCPServer), makes the edits, and verifies the wiring by checking the schema includes
  the telemetry block and a test tool call produces a signed batch.

# Install @armature-tech/mcp-analytics into an MCP server

You are integrating the `@armature-tech/mcp-analytics` SDK into a customer's MCP server
codebase. The SDK decorates each tool's input schema with a `telemetry.*` block (so the
agent can pass `intent`, `context`, `frustration_level`), strips those fields before the
handler runs, and posts a signed batch to Armature after each call.

The hard part is picking the right integration shape and not breaking the existing server.
Four shapes exist; pick one based on how the customer's code looks today.

## Step 1: Identify the integration shape

Read enough of the repo to classify it. Grep first; only open files you need.

| Signal | Shape |
| --- | --- |
| `package.json` depends on `@mastra/mcp` or `@mastra/core`, code calls `new MCPServer({ tools })` | **D. Mastra** |
| Code calls `new McpServer(...)` and then `server.registerTool(...)` directly | **A. Drop-in** |
| Code is new / customer wants to define tools through us | **B. Registry-style** |
| Code hand-rolls `tools/list` and `tools/call` handlers, dispatching by name | **C. Dispatcher** |

Mastra (Shape D) check first — it's the only one keyed off a dependency, and `@mastra/mcp`'s
`MCPServer` looks superficially like the SDK's `McpServer` but is a different surface, so
Shapes A–C will not fit. A factory that constructs the MCP SDK's `McpServer` and registers
tools inside is the next most common — that's shape A. Don't ask the user which shape to
pick; figure it out from the code and announce your choice in one line before editing.

If the repo has multiple MCP servers, ask the user which one (use `AskUserQuestion`). Don't
guess.

## Step 2: Install the dependencies

```sh
npm install @armature-tech/mcp-analytics
```

`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and `zod` are peer-ish — they should already be in the project.
If they aren't, install them too. Use the customer's package manager (check for
`pnpm-lock.yaml` / `yarn.lock` / `bun.lockb` and match it).

The package is published to GitHub Packages under the `@armature-tech` scope. If `npm install`
fails with 404, the project needs a `.npmrc`:

```
@armature-tech:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

Mention this once; don't litter the project with auth instructions.

## Step 3: Add the three environment variables

The SDK needs:

| Variable | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `ANALYTICS_INGEST_URL` | `https://app.armature.tech/api/mcp-analytics/ingest` for prod |
| `ANALYTICS_MCP_SERVER_ID` | The MCP server id from the Armature dashboard |
| `ANALYTICS_INGEST_SECRET` | The shared secret from the Armature dashboard |

Add them to whatever env mechanism the project uses (`.env.example`, `wrangler.toml`,
`vercel.json`, fly secrets, k8s manifests). Do **not** commit real values; put placeholders
in `.env.example` and tell the user where to paste the real ones.

If either `ANALYTICS_MCP_SERVER_ID` or `ANALYTICS_INGEST_SECRET` is missing at runtime,
the SDK silently no-ops. That's intentional for local dev — say so once, don't add guards.

## Step 4: Pick a delivery mode

The default is `delivery: "background"` which schedules the post on `setImmediate`. That
**will drop batches in serverless** because the function exits before the immediate fires.

Use this decision table:

| Runtime | `delivery` |
| --- | --- |
| Vercel / Lambda / Cloudflare Workers / any per-request serverless | `"await"` |
| Long-lived Node process, container, fly machine, persistent server | `"background"` + call `recorder.flush()` on `SIGTERM` |

Detect the runtime from the repo (look for `vercel.json`, `wrangler.toml`, `Dockerfile`,
`fly.toml`, `package.json` scripts). If you're not sure, default to `"await"` — it's the
safe choice and only costs a few ms per call.

## Step 5: Make the edits

### Shape A — Drop-in

Wrap the existing server factory. Don't rewrite tool definitions.

```ts
import { createMcpAnalyticsServer } from "@armature-tech/mcp-analytics";

// before:
// const server = createMyMcpServer();

// after:
const server = createMcpAnalyticsServer(
  () => createMyMcpServer(),
  {
    armature: {
      // endpointUrl / mcpServerId / ingestSecret default to env vars
      delivery: "await", // or "background" — see Step 4
    },
  },
);
```

If the factory isn't already a function (e.g. the file does `const server = new McpServer(...)`
at module top-level and then `server.registerTool(...)` calls follow), refactor it into a
function first — `createMcpAnalyticsServer` needs to control the call site so the
`AsyncLocalStorage` context is active when `registerTool` runs. One small refactor:

```ts
// before
const server = new McpServer({ name, version });
server.registerTool("foo", ...);
server.registerTool("bar", ...);
export { server };

// after
const createServer = () => {
  const server = new McpServer({ name, version });
  server.registerTool("foo", ...);
  server.registerTool("bar", ...);
  return server;
};
export const server = createMcpAnalyticsServer(createServer);
```

If you need `recorder.flush()` (serverless), use `withMcpAnalytics` instead and call
`await recorder.flush()` at the end of the request handler. Don't sprinkle `flush()` calls
through tool handlers — once per request, at the end, is enough.

### Shape B — Registry-style

The recorder owns the tool registry. Define tools on the recorder, then ask it to build
the server.

```ts
import { createAnalyticsRecorder } from "@armature-tech/mcp-analytics";
import { z } from "zod";

const analytics = createAnalyticsRecorder({
  armature: { delivery: "await" },
});

analytics.tool<{ customer: string }>(
  {
    name: "lookup_customer",
    description: "Look up a customer by name.",
    inputSchema: { customer: z.string().min(1) },
  },
  async (args) => {
    return { content: [{ type: "text", text: await lookup(args.customer) }] };
  },
);

const server = analytics.createMcpServer({ name: "my-mcp", version });
await server.connect(transport);
```

Use this only on greenfield code. Don't rewrite an existing server into this shape — use
Shape A instead.

### Shape C — Dispatcher

For servers that publish a JSON-Schema tool catalog and route `tools/call` by name without
ever touching `McpServer.registerTool`:

```ts
import { createAnalyticsRecorder } from "@armature-tech/mcp-analytics";

const analytics = createAnalyticsRecorder({
  armature: {
    delivery: "await",
    actorId: ({ ctx }) => (ctx as RequestContext).userProfileId,
  },
});

// Register each tool with the recorder — same definitions you had before.
analytics.tool<{ customer_id: string }>(
  {
    name: "lookup_customer",
    description: "Look up a customer by id.",
    inputSchema: {
      type: "object",
      properties: { customer_id: { type: "string" } },
      required: ["customer_id"],
    },
  },
  async (args, { ctx }) => db.customers.lookup(args.customer_id, ctx),
);

// In the tools/list handler:
return { tools: analytics.toolDefinitions() };

// In the tools/call handler:
return await analytics.dispatch(name, rawArgs, { ctx, sessionId });
```

The `sessionId` should come from whatever you already track per-connection (the MCP
session id from the `Mcp-Session-Id` header, your own session table, etc.). If the customer
has no session concept, pass a stable per-connection id — the SDK uses it to fire one
`session_init` event per new session.

### Shape D — Mastra

For servers built on `@mastra/mcp`'s `MCPServer` with tools defined via
`createTool({...})` from `@mastra/core/tools`. The Mastra adapter operates at the **tool
level**: it extends each tool's Zod `inputSchema` with the telemetry block, wraps each
`execute` to strip telemetry from input and emit a batch, and returns a fresh tool map
you pass straight back into `new MCPServer({ tools })`.

```ts
import { wrapMastraTools } from "@armature-tech/mcp-analytics/mastra";

new MCPServer({
  id: "my-mcp",
  name: "My MCP",
  version: "0.0.1",
  tools: wrapMastraTools(createMyTools(), {
    armature: { delivery: "await" },
  }),
  resources: myResources,
});
```

If the server needs `flush()` (long-lived process on `delivery: "background"`) or
shares a recorder across multiple tool maps, use `createMastraAnalytics`:

```ts
import { createMastraAnalytics } from "@armature-tech/mcp-analytics/mastra";

const analytics = createMastraAnalytics({ armature: { delivery: "background" } });
new MCPServer({ tools: analytics.wrapTools(createMyTools()), ... });
process.on("SIGTERM", () => analytics.flush());
```

To propagate `sessionId` / `authInfo` from Mastra's per-call context, pass a
`resolveExtra` callback. Mastra's `execute(inputData, context)` second argument is whatever
the customer's tools already receive — read from it:

```ts
wrapMastraTools(tools, {
  armature: { delivery: "await" },
  resolveExtra: (mastraContext) => ({
    sessionId: (mastraContext as any)?.runtimeContext?.get?.("sessionId"),
    authInfo: (mastraContext as any)?.requestContext?.authInfo,
  }),
});
```

`actorId` is configured the normal way on `config.armature.actorId` — the resolver
receives `ctx` set to Mastra's second-arg context.

The SDK does not import `@mastra/*` at runtime (structural typing), so the adapter
works with whatever Mastra version the customer is on. Do not add `@mastra/*` to
their dependencies — it's already there if Shape D applies.

### Recording session_init at handshake (optional, all shapes)

By default, `session_init` fires the first time a sessionId shows up in `recordToolCall`.
If the customer wants the event to fire at MCP handshake time even when the client never
calls a tool, add this inside the `initialize` JSON-RPC handler:

```ts
await analytics.recordSessionInit({ sessionId, ctx });
```

Only mention this if the customer asks about session tracking, or if their MCP server
already has a custom `initialize` handler — otherwise skip it.

## Step 6: Verify the wiring

Two checks. Don't skip them.

**Check 1 — Schema includes telemetry.** Spin up the server, ask it for `tools/list`, and
confirm one of the tools has a `telemetry` property in its `inputSchema`. If the project
has a dev server script, use it; otherwise write a 10-line script that imports the factory
and calls `server.tool()` listing. Stop and investigate if the schema isn't decorated —
that means the `AsyncLocalStorage` context wasn't active when `registerTool` ran (most
common cause: tools registered outside the factory in Shape A).

**Check 2 — A real tool call produces a batch.** Either:

- Run a tool against the local mock at `http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/mcp-analytics/ingest`
  (set `ANALYTICS_INGEST_URL` to it and run `npm run dev:armature` if the SDK repo is
  checked out locally), or
- Set `armature.emit` in the config to a stub that captures the batch, fire a test tool
  call, and assert the captured batch has one `tool_call` event with the right tool name.

A passing typecheck is not verification. The schema decoration and the signed batch are
what matter — verify both.

## Step 7: Mention the gotchas, then stop

Tell the user, briefly:

- `delivery: "background"` drops batches in serverless. You picked `"await"` (or not — say which).
- The SDK no-ops silently if env vars are missing. Set them in prod.
- The package is on GitHub Packages, so CI needs the `.npmrc` line from Step 2 with a `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`.

Don't pad with anything else. End with one line: what you changed and what the user needs
to do (paste the secrets, deploy).

## What NOT to do

- Don't add error handling around `recorder.recordToolCall` — the SDK swallows emit errors
  via `onError`. Wrapping it adds noise.
- Don't add a `try/catch` around `flush()` either. Pass `onError` in config if the user
  wants custom handling.
- Don't expose the ingest secret to the client side — it's server-only. If you see it
  imported in a browser bundle path, stop and flag it.
- Don't rewrite tool definitions to "match the SDK style" if Shape A works. Minimum
  change wins.
- Don't add a `MCP_ANALYTICS_ENABLED` feature flag. `armature.enabled: false` already
  exists and the SDK no-ops on missing env vars.
